This project is a simple website that has links to few recipes.
completing this project I will have demonstrated new found git skills,good commit messages and solid understanding of html tags,structure,encoding and css.
The site is available on https://muchiri-cmd.github.io/odin-recipes/ though i recommend using a laptop.Its not mobile responsive yet.
